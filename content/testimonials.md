  - content: "## Robyn\n\n*\"My name is Robyn, I'm 78 years old.\_I have  had 2 knee replacements, within the last 18 months. My bone structure throughout my body has deteriorated\_so badly, it is inoperable causing constant back pain. I have lost 4 inches (100mm)\_ in height. The pain has become so intense, I really didn't want to live anymore, I had given up wanting to live, and then I met David and decided to have his treatment. With only one treatment, all the pain I was experiencing, disappeared, and hasn't come back. I have given up my walker, and I can honestly feel my body healing. I\_would like to go back to riding horses, and, according to David , that is very possible given time.\"*\n"
