My bone structure throughout my body has deteriorated\_so badly, it is inoperable causing constant back pain. I have lost 4 inches (100mm)\_ in height. The pain has become so intense, I really didn't want to live anymore, I had given up wanting to live, and then I met David and decided to have his treatment. With only one treatment, all the pain I was experiencing, disappeared, and hasn't come back. I have given up my walker, and I can honestly feel my body healing. I\_would like to go back to riding horses, and, according to David , that is very possible given time.\"*\n\nRobyn - 23/01/2017\n\n## &#xA;John Ross\n\n*\"I\_\_was diagnosed with an aggressive prostrate cancer in Dec 2012, I underwent treatment from Auckland Hospital which finished in mid Sept.
