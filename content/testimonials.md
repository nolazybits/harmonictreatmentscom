My bone structure throughout my body has deteriorated\_so badly, it is inoperable causing constant back pain. I have lost 4 inches (100mm)\_ in height. The pain has become so intense, I really didn't want to live anymore, I had given up wanting to live, and then I met David and decided to have his treatment. With only one treatment, all the pain I was experiencing, disappeared, and hasn't come back. I have given up my walker, and I can honestly feel my body healing. I\_would like to go back to riding horses, and, according to David , that is very possible given time.\"*\n\nRobyn - 23/01/2017\n\n## &#xA;John Ross\n\n*\"I\_\_was diagnosed with an aggressive prostrate cancer in Dec 2012, I underwent treatment from Auckland Hospital which finished in mid Sept. I was\_continuously\_tired, no energy-lethargic, really bad headaches and visiting the toilet up to 35 times\_plus per day,\_ this was\_interrupting\_my sleep big time.\nAfter just 4 visits to David I felt like I'd got my \"Life\" back, tiredness gone, toilet visits drastically reduced, Headaches gone, energy back, sleeping well.*\\\n*My overall body feeling of wellness-feeling good had returned.*\\\n*I was asked by the cancer doctor to do some follow up tests in March 13. which I did , they called me back for the results, they said I was all clear of any cancer. This I already knew !*\\\n*I continued to see David once or twice a month. I am am eternally grateful to David and\_definitely\_recommend his\_Therapy\_/ Healing to any person.\"*\n\nJohn Ross - 17/07/2013\n\n## *&#xA;Jennifer*\n\n*\"In April 2012 something happened to me and I lost the ability to move the right side of my body. I was very shaky, trembling right hand, arm jolting from the shoulder, trembling right hand. Could not put index finger to nose or out to front. Finger would shake and\_therefore finger would go either side of my nose when trying to touch it. Also putting one finger at a time to meet with thumb. Fingers were shaking too much for them to meet.I was unable to open and shut hand because of pain. Could not clasp. No strength. Could not use hand.My speech was shaky and broken and was having trouble getting words out. I could not have a conversation. My cheek was twitching uncontrollably.\_*\n\n*After 4 months the doctors came to the \_conclusion I was suffering from Rassmaston syndrome and I would be suffering with this problem for the rest of my life. My Mum had been to David 23 years previous because she had asthma, which David healed. Thank God she managed to track him down and he was still doing his healing.*\n\n*On the first treatment with David my movement on my right side\_improved out of sight. Also my speech improved and has done so with each treatment I have had.*\n\n*I can now lead a normal life.\"*\n\nJennifer - 2012\n\n## &#xA;Robyn\n\n\\*\"My name is Robyn, I'm 78 years old.\_I have  had 2 knee replacements, within the last 18 months.
