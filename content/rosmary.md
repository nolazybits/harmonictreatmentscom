The electronic machine you will be treated on is affectionately called "Rosemary". She scans through frequencies that not only change in wavelength, but also the intensity of the wavelength is constantly altering.

This creates harmonics that can penetrate the deepest and well established problems and break their hold on whatever is been affected in the body. It doesn't matter if its joint problems, asthma, cancer, depression, pain relief comes almost instantly.           

"Rosemary" runs on a 12 volt battery making it safe for whomever is connected to her. She is a harmonic generator. It took me over 2 years to create her and I switched her on for the first time on the 26/6/1982.\
I never turn her off...
